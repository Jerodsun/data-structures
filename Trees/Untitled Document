*linked_queue and exceptions support generating a breadth-first traversal.

tree:
Abstract base class supporting preorder, postorder, and breadth-first traversals.

  def __iter__(self):
    """Generate an iteration of the tree's elements."""
    for p in self.positions():                        # use same order as positions()
      yield p.element()                               # but yield each element

Default iteration type can be changed here.

  def positions(self):
    """Generate an iteration of the tree's positions."""
    return self.preorder()                            # return entire preorder iteration

Iteration of positional elements vs. positions.

binary_tree:
Abstract base class representing a binary tree structure. Adds inorder support.

linked_binary_tree:
Concrete linked implementation of a binary tree. Not related to linked lists.

g = LinkedBinaryTree()
g._add_root("root")
g._add_left(g.root(), "left")
g._add_right(g.root(), "right")
for i in g.positions():
    print(i.element())
    
#left, root, right

euler_tour:
Implementation of a euler tour by passing a tree structure used. 

expression_tree:
A demonstration of using a linked binary tree to create an expression tree and evaluate the answer.


Binary search trees are like sorted maps, except with a tree structure with key-values instead of arrays.

binary_search_tree:
Basic implementation of a binary search tree, with calls to presumed methods of _rebalance_insert/delete/access. Those will be implemented in balanced search trees.
• Elements stored in the left subtree of p (if any) are less than e(p).
• Elements stored in the right subtree of p (if any) are greater than e(p).

avl_tree:
AVL trees satisfy the height-balance property: For every position p, the heights of the children of p differ by at most 1. Note that it means that every subtree is an AVL tree. Height is at most 2*logn + 2.

splay_tree:
Move-to-front heuristic. The most recently accessed position is splayed until it becomes the new root. Rememeber that it retains the properties of binary_search_tree.
