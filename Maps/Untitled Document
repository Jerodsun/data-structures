An application of maps (demonstrated in word_frequency) is to get the word count for each word.

map_base:
Abstract map base.

hash_map_base:
Abstract base class with randomized multiply-add-and-divide (MAD) hash implementation.

chain_hash_map:
Map implementation with separate chaining.

probe_hash_map:
Map implementation with linear probing.


---- Advantages of sorted maps ----
Normal maps only allow for exact search - if a key is missing, it won't be found. Ex. time series. 
Sorted maps allow:
find_min, find_max
find_lt(k) (greatest key strictly less than k), find_le(k) (or equal to)
find_gt(k) (least key strictly greater than k), find__e(k) (or equal to)
find_range(start, stop)

By using a sorted search table with binary search.

sorted_table_map:
Map implementation using a sorted table. Sorted tables are good for many searches, relatively few updates as M[k] = v has O(n) worst case time - a shift throughout the index.
